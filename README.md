# Koi Mama ?

A mobile application to track all friends simultaneously. It shows real
time location on Google Map with profile picture as mini-marker, or
shows their last location and time when they were active. A user can
create/log into his account, make his own profile, follow his friend by
searching with user name and also can see who he follows and is
followed by. It was ensured that no one could find a user without being
provided an authentic user ID. The application was developed using
Flutter and Dart, and Firebase as backend.
