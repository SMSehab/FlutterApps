## Overview

LocateBuddy is a real-time friend-tracking mobile application that allows you to stay connected with your inner circle. See your friends' current locations on a dynamic Google Map, marked with their profile pictures for easy identification. If a friend is offline, LocateBuddy displays their last known location and the time they were last active. With LocateBuddy, you can create a personalized profile, connect with friends by searching for their usernames, and manage your network of followers and followees. Security is paramount: LocateBuddy ensures that users can only be found and followed by those who have their authentic user ID. Built with Flutter and Dart, and powered by Firebase, LocateBuddy offers a seamless and secure way to keep track of your friends.
